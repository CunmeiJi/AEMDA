# AEMDA
Implementation of AEMDA for inferring potential disease-miRNA associations. Our method contains three sub-models: a disease model for learning representation of diseases, a miRNA model for learning representation of miRNA, and an autoencoder based model for predicting. 

# Requirements
  * PyTorch 1.0 or higher
  * GPU (default).

# Usage
  * download code and data
  * execute ```python main.py``` to train a predictor
  

Note: If you wanna infer disease-specific miRNAs, you should use the concatenated vector $[d, m_i]$ as the input of the predictor and get the reconstruction error, this process repeat $nm$ times, while $nm$ is the number of miRNAs. Then, sort all candidates and you can analyze for further biological experiments.
